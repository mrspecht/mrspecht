## About me

Educator and developer with over 10 years of experience helping learners build skills through effective, engaging training. With a background in adult education, learning design, and coding, I'm passionate about making complex topics accessible and designing learning experiences that drive meaningful results.

I bring strong communication and interpersonal skills to my work, with a focus on creating inclusive environments that reflect diverse cultural perspectives. My extensive experience with LMS platforms supports successful learning outcomes and ensures smooth delivery in both in-person and online settings.

Working with academic stakeholders and industry experts, I've designed courses, delivered hands-on instruction, and prepared students for careers in software development and digital innovation. This teamwork has made a real difference: we've seen higher course success rates, helped many students land their first jobs in tech, and even watched some graduates become instructors â€” a rewarding cycle that serves as a constant source of inspiration and motivation.

Beyond helping others learn and grow, I stay active as a developer, building everything from personal websites to complex web applications. This hands-on experience keeps my problem-solving skills sharp and guides the practical insights I bring to every course I design and deliver.
