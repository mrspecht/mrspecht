## About me

Hi there! I’m Andre Specht, an experienced developer and instructor with over 
10 years of helping adult learners build real-world skills through practical, 
engaging training. I bring together a background in tech, instructional design, 
and a genuine love for making complex topics easier to understand. Over the 
years, I’ve worked with different teams to design courses, guide learners 
through challenges, and improve materials based on what works best for them.

Right now, I help people break into tech by teaching web development and 
programming in ways that are approachable and aligned with industry needs. I 
focus on building confidence, encouraging curiosity, and supporting learners as 
they grow both their technical and professional skills.

Beyond teaching, I’ve also built a range of projects, from personal websites to 
more complex applications. These real-world experiences have strengthened my 
problem-solving skills and shaped the best practices I now share with both 
domestic and international learners. They’ve also helped me stay grounded in 
what people need to grow and succeed in an ever-evolving tech landscape.

Would you like to know more? Get in touch. I look forward to hearing 
from you.
